       <h4>ABOUT</h4><hr>
    <p>Encanto is a 2021 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. 
        It was directed by Jared Bush, and Byron Howard and written by Charise Castro Smith and Bush, 
        with original songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a score composed by Germaine Franco. 
        The film stars the voices of Stephanie Beatriz, María Cecilia Botero, John Leguizamo, Mauro Castillo [es], 
        Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, Carolina Gaitán, Diane Guerrero, and Wilmer Valderrama. Encanto follows a multigenerational Colombian family, 
        the Madrigals, led by a matriarch whose children and grandchildren—except for Mirabel Madrigal—receive magical gifts from a miracle, 
        which they use to help the people in their rural community, called the Encanto. When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, 
        she sets out to find out why and save the family and house.</p>
